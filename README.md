# Getting Started with Coffee Brew Notes

Here is my project roadmap [on Notion](https://www.notion.so/Coffee-App-38a19ea55f714a33874ca197f000e241).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
