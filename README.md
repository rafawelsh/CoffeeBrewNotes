# Coffee Brew Notes â˜•

The idea behind this project is to create a digital notebook for coffee enthusiast to better dial in their coffee. Dialing in a coffee refers to finding the preffered variables to brew a favorable cup of coffee. With myriad origins, varietals, and processing combinations it can be fun to find the personal perfect cup.
The dialing process is typically done on paper which works wonders when dialing in current bag of coffee. But after weeks, months, years of drinking coffee people are bound to lose golden recipes. This is what I hope to help with.
This app would make the process of dialing coffee and sharing that experience easier and hopefully introduce new coffee enthusiasts to next level recipes.
